# Multiquery Strategy (Priority #3)

## 🧠 The Mindset
**Don't just ask "What". Ask "How" and "Why".**
Single queries give facts. Multiple queries give wisdom.

## 🎯 Workflow: 3-5 Queries
For any complex problem, run this sequence:

1. **Concept (WHAT)**
   - "What is [Concept]?"
   - "Define [Concept] in simple terms."

2. **Mindset (WHY)**
   - "Why does [Concept] matter?"
   - "What is the philosophy behind [Concept]?"

3. **Approach (HOW)**
   - "Step-by-step approach to implementing [Concept]."
   - "How to think like an expert when using [Concept]?"

4. **Expert Opinion (WHO)**
   - "Expert recommendations for [Concept]."
   - "Common pitfalls in [Concept]."

## 📝 Example: TDD
1. "What is TDD?"
2. "Why use TDD? Benefits vs Cost."
3. "Step-by-step TDD workflow."
4. "Martin Fowler's opinion on TDD."
5. "Common TDD mistakes."
